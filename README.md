# php-bitfinex-v2
PHP Bitfinex API (v2)

This is still a work in progress. I built this as I wanted to script pushover notifications from Bitfinex to my phone on a time interval. I found a bunch of v1 classes, but nothing PHP related to Bitfinex's V2 API. It's currently basic, and only fetches wallet balances, currency pairs (tickers), and orders. Depending on free time, I may or may not write all the additional V2 functions. The existing functions only pass the relevant data I was looking for. A full list of additional JSON array items can be found here: https://docs.bitfinex.com/v2/reference

Requirements:
- A Bitfinex account with an API Key and Secret enabled.
- A server that runs PHP (duh.).
- Read example.php for a basic understanding.
